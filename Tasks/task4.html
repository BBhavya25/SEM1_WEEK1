      HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create
      and design webpages. It provides the basic structure of a webpage,
      allowing developers to define the content using elements such as headings,
      paragraphs, links, images, and more. HTML elements are represented by
      tags, usually enclosedin angle brackets which tell the browser how to
      display the content. It is not a programming language but a markup
      language that organizes text and multimedia into a readable format for web
      browsers. HTML forms the foundation of web development, often combined
      with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity.
