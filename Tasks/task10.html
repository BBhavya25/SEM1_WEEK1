    <h1>Main Title (H1)</h1>
    <p>
      The H1 heading is used for the most important heading on the page,
      typically for the title or main topic. It should only appear once per page
      and is usually the largest heading. It's best suited for page titles, blog
      post titles, or main headings that represent the overall subject of the
      page.
    </p>
    <h2>Subheading (H2)</h2>
    <p>
      The H2 heading is used for major sections within a page. It helps break
      down content into logical parts under the main heading. Use it for major
      subtopics, section titles, or important content areas that are a step
      below the main H1 heading.
    </p>

    <h3>Sub-Subheading (H3)</h3>
    <p>
      The H3 heading is used for subsections within the H2 sections. It is often
      used for smaller categories or topics that fall under the larger H2
      headings. This is best suited for detailing specific aspects of the
      sections above.
    </p>

    <h4>Smaller Section Title (H4)</h4>
    <p>
      The H4 heading is used for even more specific subdivisions of content.
      It's helpful when you need to divide a topic further within an H3 section.
      It can be used for subsections, side topics, or further explanations of a
      concept.
    </p>

    <h5>Minor Section Title (H5)</h5>
    <p>
      The H5 heading is used for smaller, less important sections. It's rarely
      used unless your content is heavily structured and needs deeper
      organization. It can be used for additional notes or small detail
      sections.
    </p>

    <h6>Smallest Section Title (H6)</h6>
    <p>
      The H6 heading is the smallest and least prominent heading. It is rarely
      used but can be helpful for labeling very minor sections, footnotes, or
      disclaimers. It's suitable for content that is subordinate to all other
      headings above it.
