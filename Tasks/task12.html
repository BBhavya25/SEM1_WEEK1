      In physics, one of the most famous equations is Einstein's mass-energy
      equivalence formula: E = mc<sup>2</sup>, where E is energy, m is mass, and
      c is the speed of light. In chemistry, the molecular formula for glucose
      is C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, indicating six carbon, twelve
      hydrogen, and six oxygen atoms. In mathematics, the Pythagorean theorem
      states that a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>, where a, b, and
      c represent the sides of a right-angled triangle. The notation for
      chemical isotopes can also be written as U<sup>235</sup>, where the
      superscript indicates the isotope's mass number. Similarly, subscript is
      commonly used in formulas like CO<sub>2</sub> for carbon dioxide or
      H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
      for sulfuric acid.
