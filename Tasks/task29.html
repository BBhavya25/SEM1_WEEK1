    <h1>The Journey of Orion</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1: The Mysterious Map</h2>
    <p>
      Orion was no ordinary boy. On his 15th birthday, he found a strange,
      ancient map tucked away in his attic. The map pointed to a hidden treasure
      deep in the Forgotten Mountains, a place feared by all. But Orion's
      curiosity had always been stronger than his fear.
    </p>
    <h2>Chapter 2: The First Steps</h2>
    <p>
      With the map in hand, Orion set off on his journey. The path was long and
      winding, but his excitement kept him moving forward. Along the way, he met
      an old traveler named Eira, who claimed to know about the treasure and
      offered to help him on his quest.

    <h2>Chapter 3: Into the Mountains</h2>
      <p>
        The Forgotten Mountains were as intimidating as the stories had said.
        Sharp cliffs, dense fog, and eerie silence surrounded them as they
        climbed higher. But with Eira's guidance and Orion's determination, they
        pushed forward. Little did they know, their adventure was just
        beginning, and what they would discover was far more than just treasure.
