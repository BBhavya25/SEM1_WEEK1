    <h1>The Tale of the Lost Star</h1>

    <h2>Chapter 1: The Star Falls</h2>
    <p>
      On a quiet, moonlit night, a brilliant star fell from the sky. This star
      wasn't like any other—it was the brightest in the heavens, known to guide
      sailors across the seas. But tonight, it plummeted to the Earth, landing
      in the middle of a vast, enchanted forest.

    <h3>Chapter 2: The Search Begins</h3>
    <p>
      Far away in the small village of Eldoria, a young girl named Luna had seen
      the star fall. Luna had always dreamed of the stars and believed they held
      magical powers. Determined to find the lost star, she packed her bag with
      food, water, and her trusty lantern, setting off on an adventure into the
      forest.

    <h4>Chapter 3: The Forest of Whispers</h4>
    <p>
      The forest was a mysterious place, known as the Forest of Whispers. As
      Luna walked deeper into its heart, she could hear the soft voices of the
      trees, guiding her steps. But the journey wasn’t easy. The path was
      twisted, and shadows danced around her. Yet Luna's determination burned as
      brightly as the fallen star she sought.
