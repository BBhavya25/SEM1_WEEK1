      CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to describe
      the presentation of a document written in HTML. It controls how HTML
      elements are displayed on the screen, including layout, colors, fonts,
      spacing, and overall visual aesthetics. By separating content (HTML) from
      design (CSS), web developers can easily maintain and update websites
      without affecting the underlying structure.

      JavaScript is a versatile and powerful programming language that enables
      dynamic and interactive functionality on websites. Unlike HTML, which
      structures the content, and CSS, which styles it, JavaScript allows
      developers to create real-time updates, control multimedia, animate
      images, handle form validation, and more.
